# ree-emotes (0.1.0)

This is a plugin for FiveM, it requires [ree-core](https://github.com/REE-FiveM/ree-core)
as a dependency.

> #### Under Development
> This plugin is still under development and not ready for live server use yet.
> The following features and bugs still exist:
> * Player cannot cancel emote by moving
> * More user friendly emotes need to be added
> * Invalid emotes aren't handled yet


## Commands

If the command has an exclamation mark in it, then the previous/current emote
will stop playing immediately, even mid-animation. This is helpful for when 
an animation is glitched.

### Playing Emotes
Players will be able to play emotes with the `/e <emote>` and `/e! <emote>` commands.

### Cancelling Emotes
Players can cancel emotes by using either the `/ce` or `/ce!` command.
